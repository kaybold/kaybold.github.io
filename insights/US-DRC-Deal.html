The U.S.–DRC Strategic Partnership Agreement is the kind of deal people love to overrate or dismiss too quickly.

Both reactions miss the point.

This agreement matters. And not because it is automatically good. It matters because it is trying to solve a real problem that has defined Congo for decades. The country has enormous mineral wealth. And that wealth has too often fed war, smuggling networks, and outside interests instead of building security, infrastructure, and public benefit. The agreement itself was published by the U.S. State Department on December 4, 2025. 

So, I get the appeal of this deal.

On paper, it sounds like a serious correction. A framework. A steering committee. A push for traceability. A way to connect minerals to investment and logistics instead of just extraction. And if that actually happens, it could be a real shift. It could help move mining into more formal channels. It could give the Congolese state more leverage. It could create something closer to governance than improvisation. The State Department also announced the inaugural Joint Steering Committee meeting on February 5, 2026, which shows this is in implementation mode, not just announcement mode. 

But here is the problem. And it is a big one.

This deal may be trying to create a conflict-free supply chain before the conflict is under control.

That is not a small technical issue. That is the whole story.

Reuters reported that the DRC included the Rubaya coltan mine in a list of strategic assets under the minerals framework even though Rubaya was under AFC/M23 control at the time. Reuters also described Rubaya as one of the world’s richest tantalum sources, said it contributes about 15% of global coltan supply, and reported Congolese estimates that restarting operations would require roughly $50 million to $150 million. Another source amplified the same Reuters reporting for the mining audience, which is part of why this detail now sits at the center of the debate.

And this is where the agreement becomes both smart and shaky at the same time.

Smart because it identifies what actually matters. High-value mineral assets. Strategic supply chains. Real economic leverage.

Shaky because it exposes the gap between what a government can sign and what it can enforce. There is a difference between sovereignty on paper and control on the ground. And in eastern Congo, that difference is not abstract. It is violent. It is political. It shapes everything. Reuters also flagged contested ownership and governance concerns around Rubaya, which makes the “traceability” promise harder to operationalize, not easier. (Reuters, Feb. 18, 2026)

So, when people talk about “traceability” and “conflict-free sourcing,” I do not think the right response is cynicism. But I also do not think the right response is applause.

The right response is pressure.

Pressure on sequencing. Pressure on enforcement. Pressure on transparency. Pressure on whether this is actually improving life for Congolese communities or just improving language around access for foreign buyers.

Because that is the risk. That “partnership” becomes a cleaner word for the same old arrangement.

And to be clear, this does not mean the agreement is pointless.

It means the agreement should be judged by outcomes, not branding.

Not by how strategic it sounds in Washington. Not by how exciting it looks to investors. But by whether it produces visible gains in Congo. Security. Jobs. Infrastructure. Public revenue people can actually track. Less smuggling. Less armed-group financing.

And the broader context matters here too. AP reported that the June 27, 2025 U.S.-mediated DRC–Rwanda peace deal was framed as a major step, while also noting skepticism and the ongoing challenge posed by armed groups, including M23. 

If that happens, this could be a meaningful step.

And if it does not, then this will read like a very modern version of a very old story. A polished minerals deal built on an unstable foundation.
