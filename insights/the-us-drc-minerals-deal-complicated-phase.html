      <p>The U.S.–DRC strategic minerals partnership is entering a more complicated phase.</p>

      <p>What began as a supply-chain story is now intersecting with domestic politics, active conflict, and geopolitical competition. Over the past several weeks, the pace of developments has accelerated, and the risk profile is becoming clearer.</p>

      <p><strong>We are now seeing:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>a constitutional challenge inside the DRC</li>
        <li>Western capital positioning around major assets</li>
        <li>Belgium pushing back on exclusive geological data access</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Individually, each development matters. Together, they show the partnership has moved firmly into execution territory.</p>

      <h2>Legal Pressure Is Building in Kinshasa</h2>

      <p>In January 2026, Congolese lawyers and civil society actors filed a constitutional challenge seeking to invalidate the U.S.–DRC Strategic Partnership. Critics argue the agreement could alter the legal framework governing natural resources without following required domestic procedures (Oakland Institute, 2026).</p>

      <p>Even if the case ultimately fails, this signals the partnership is now an important part of Congo’s internal sovereignty debate. For investors, this could translate into longer timelines, closer scrutiny of deal structures, and a higher policy risk premium.</p>

      <p>Historically, legal friction rarely stops mining investment outright. But now it can slow momentum at exactly the stage when speed matters most.</p>

      <h2>Kinshasa Is Expanding the Strategic Asset Pipeline</h2>

      <p>Despite what some might call “legal noise,” the Congolese government is pushing forward commercially.</p>

      <p>Recent reporting indicates the DRC has offered U.S. counterparts a shortlist of strategic assets, including the Rubaya coltan (tantalum) area, a zone influenced by the M23/AFC rebel coalition. These zones span copper-cobalt, lithium, manganese, and gold, many linked to Gécamines (Reuters, Jan. 2026; Reuters, Feb. 2026).</p>

      <p>This is a meaningful shift. The partnership is no longer just diplomatic language; it now has a visible project funnel. That overlap between strategic minerals and contested ground control is where Congo risk typically concentrates.</p>

      <h2>Security Shock: M23 Leadership Hit Near Rubaya</h2>

      <p>The security picture shifted again this week.</p>

      <p>A senior M23 spokesperson, Willy Ngoma, was reported killed in a drone strike near the Rubaya area, a key coltan hub that has become financially significant in the conflict economy (Reuters, Feb. 24, 2026; AP News, 2026).</p>

      <p><strong>Why this matters</strong></p>

      <p>This development introduces two competing dynamics.</p>

      <p><strong>In the short term:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>risk of retaliation cycles</li>
        <li>potential disruption around the mining zone</li>
        <li>higher security premiums for future investors</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Over the medium term (less certain):</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>if government forces consolidate control</li>
        <li>formalization of the site could become more plausible</li>
      </ul>

      <p>For now, the immediate effect is heightened volatility around a strategically important mineral area.</p>

      <h2>Early U.S.-Aligned Capital Is Moving Carefully</h2>

      <p>Despite the noise, capital is testing entry points.</p>

      <p>The clearest signal so far is the Orion Critical Mineral Consortium (Orion CMC), backed in part by U.S. development finance, which is in talks to acquire a 40% stake in Glencore’s major DRC copper-cobalt operations, including Mutanda and KCC (Reuters, Feb. 2026).</p>

      <p>The positioning is deliberate.</p>

      <p><strong>Early Western capital is prioritizing:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>producing assets</li>
        <li>established infrastructure</li>
        <li>faster paths to cash flow</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Notably, this activity is concentrated in the relatively more stable southern Copperbelt, not eastern greenfield zones like Rubaya.</p>

      <p><em>Investor read-through:</em> risk capital is still avoiding eastern exposure.</p>

      <h2>Belgium Adds a New Layer: Control of Geological Data</h2>

      <p>Another friction point has emerged in Europe.</p>

      <p>Belgium’s Royal Museum for Central Africa recently declined to grant KoBold Metals exclusive access to extensive colonial-era geological archives, stating the data should be broadly available rather than preferentially allocated to a single company (Financial Times, 2026).</p>

      <p>Belgium is instead pursuing an EU-funded digitization effort. This does not block U.S. investment. But it highlights a new competitive dimension in the minerals race: data advantage.</p>

      <p>Historical subsurface data in the DRC remains extremely valuable. For AI-driven explorers, access can materially accelerate targeting and reduce exploration risk.</p>

      <p>Control of information is quietly becoming part of the strategic landscape.</p>

      <h2>The Structural Risks Are Now Clearly Visible</h2>

      <p>The geological case for the DRC has not changed. The country remains central to global cobalt supply and highly significant for copper and emerging lithium potential.</p>

      <p>The constraints are above ground.</p>

      <p><strong>Key pressure points to watch:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>domestic legal stability</li>
        <li>security conditions around eastern mineral zones</li>
        <li>infrastructure reliability</li>
        <li>speed of Western capital deployment</li>
        <li>competitive positioning versus entrenched Chinese operators</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

      <p>The U.S.–DRC minerals partnership has crossed an important threshold. This partnership is no longer theoretical. Western capital is positioning. Legal scrutiny is rising. And conflict dynamics are now directly intersecting with strategic mining zones.</p>

      <p>The reported killing of a senior M23 figure near Rubaya underscores a core Congo reality: control of minerals and control of territory are becoming increasingly intertwined. The next 12–24 months will reveal whether this partnership delivers durable supply chain change, or advances more slowly than its architects intend.</p>
